# Banking Agent Application

## 1. Project Overview

The Banking Agent Application is a prototype conversational AI system designed to simulate and demonstrate the potential of AI-driven interactions within the banking sector. It provides users with an intuitive and efficient way to access banking services and information through natural language conversations. Leveraging a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning models, and a structured database, the application allows users to perform various banking tasks through simple, conversational interactions, aiming to replicate a human-like banking experience.

## 2. Key Features

* **Conversational Interface:**
    * Users can interact with the application using natural language, eliminating the need for complex menus or interfaces.
    * The agent understands and responds to user queries, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
* **Knowledge Retrieval:**
    * The application integrates a vector database (ChromaDB) to store and retrieve banking-related information from documents.
    * This enables the agent to answer user queries with accurate and relevant information.
* **Tool-Based Functionality:**
    * The agent can perform specific banking tasks (e.g., checking account balances, processing transactions) by utilizing defined tools.
    * This allows for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
* **Contextual Memory:**
    * The application maintains a conversational memory, allowing the agent to understand and respond to user queries in context.
    * This enhances the user experience by providing more personalized and relevant responses.
* **Language Model Integration:**
    * The application utilizes both Ollama (for local language models and embeddings) and Gemini (for advanced financial analysis) to enhance its natural language processing capabilities.
    * This provides a robust and flexible system.
* **Database Integration:**
    * A MySQL database is used for the storage of user account data.
* **Dockerized Deployment:**
    * The application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments across different environments.
    * This makes it very easy to deploy.
* **Streamlit User Interface:**
    * The application uses a Streamlit-based user interface, that allows for easy interaction with the banking agent.

## 3. Tech Stack

* **LangChain:**
    * A framework for developing applications powered by language models. It is used for agent orchestration, tool management, and interactions with language models and vector databases.
* **Ollama:**
    * A tool for running large language models locally. It provides local language models and embeddings for natural language processing.
* **Gemini:**
    * Google's most capable and general model. It enhances the application's financial analysis capabilities.
* **ChromaDB:**
    * A vector database used for storing and retrieving document embeddings, enabling efficient knowledge retrieval.
* **MySQL:**
    * A relational database management system used for storing user account data.
* **Streamlit:**
    * An open-source Python library used for creating web applications for machine learning and data science. It provides the user interface for the application.
* **Docker Compose:**
    * A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It is used for container orchestration.
* **Python:**
    * The primary programming language used for developing the application.

## 4. Strong Points

* **User-Friendly Interaction:**
    * The natural language interface simplifies banking tasks, making them accessible to a wider audience.
* **Efficient Knowledge Retrieval:**
    * ChromaDB provides quick access to relevant information, enabling the agent to provide accurate and timely responses.
* **Modular Architecture:**
    * LangChain facilitates easy addition of new tools and functionalities, allowing for future expansion of the agent's capabilities.
* **Cross-Platform Deployment:**
    * Docker Compose ensures consistent performance across different environments, simplifying deployment.
* **Local LLM usage:**
    * Ollama allows for local usage of LLMs, that increases privacy, and reduces reliance on external services.

## 5. Limitations

* **Prototype Stage:**
    * The current database holds information for a single user, limiting real-world applicability.
* **Processing Speed:**
    * Response times can vary, especially with complex queries or during heavy load.
* **Accuracy:**
    * Occasional incorrect responses due to limitations in natural language understanding and model accuracy.
* **Limited Toolset:**
    * The current toolset is basic and needs expansion for comprehensive banking services.
* **Security:**
    * Lacks robust user authentication and authorization features, which are crucial for protecting sensitive user data.

## 6. Reasons for Slow Processing/Incorrect Responses

* **LLM Inference Time:**
    * Language model inference can be computationally intensive, especially for complex queries, leading to delays in response times.
* **Complex Queries:**
    * Intricate user queries may require multiple processing steps, including knowledge retrieval and database queries, which can increase response time.
* **Model Limitations:**
    * Language models may struggle with nuanced or ambiguous queries, resulting in incorrect or irrelevant responses.
* **Database Query Complexity:**
    * Slow database queries, especially for large datasets or complex joins, can contribute to slow processing.
* **Resource Constraints:**
    * Limited resources on the machine running the Docker containers, such as CPU or memory, can slow down the application.

## 7. Deployment and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.**
3.  **Run Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4.  **Access the Application:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## 8. Future Enhancements

* **Expanded Toolset:**
    * Adding more tools to enable the agent to perform a wider range of banking tasks, such as bill payments, fund transfers, and loan applications.
* **User Authentication:**
    * Implementing secure user authentication to protect sensitive data and ensure authorized access to banking services.
* **Enhanced Security:**
    * Implementing docker secrets, and other security measures.
* **Improved Natural Language Understanding:**
    * Continuously improving the agent's ability to understand and respond to complex user queries, including handling slang, idioms, and context-dependent language.
* **Integration with External Banking APIs:**
    * Connecting the agent to real-time banking APIs for live data and transactions, enabling features such as real-time balance checks and transaction history.
* **Automated Testing:**
    * Adding automated unit and integration tests to ensure the application's reliability and maintainability.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * Implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process, enabling faster and more frequent releases.
